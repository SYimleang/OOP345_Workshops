# OOP345 - Object-Oriented Software Development (C++)
This repository contains my solutions for the OOP345 workshops at Seneca College. Details of each workshop will be inside their directory.

## Workshops list
#### Workshop 1: Across Translation Units
Implement aspects of linkage, storage duration, namespaces, header guards, and operating system interfaces.
#### Workshop 2: Move and Copy Semantics
Work with a large dynamically allocated array of C++ Standard Library strings and compare the performance of copy and move operations on that collection.
#### Workshop 3: Templates
Design and code several class templates and test them on different instantiations.
#### Workshop 4: Containers
Code three classes that are in composition and aggregation relations.
#### Workshop 5: Functions and Error Handling
Code a function object and a lambda expression, and handle exceptions.
#### Workshop 6: STL Containers
Store polymorphic objects in an STL container.<br>
Create a mini UNIX-like filesystem that supports a few common commands.
#### Workshop 7: STL Algorithms
Use the Algorithm category of the Standard Template Library.<br>
Create an application that manages a collection of cities from around the world and the number of COVID cases/deaths from each city in a given year.
#### Workshop 8: Smart Pointers
Exclude one collection from another and use smart pointers to ensure that memory is deallocated in the possible presence of an exception.
#### Workshop 9: Multi-Threading
Calculate the average of the values stored in a file and use multi-threading to read data from the files and to compute averages of the read data.
