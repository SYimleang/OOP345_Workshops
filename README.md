# OOP345 - Object-Oriented Software Development (C++)
This repository contains my solutions for the OOP345 workshops at Seneca College.

## Workshops list
#### Workshop 1: Across Translation Units
Subdivide a program into modules, compile each module separately, and construct an executable from the results of each compilation. In Part 2, write a modular program.
#### Workshop 2: Dynamic Memory, References, Overloading
Use references to modify the content of variables in other scopes, overload functions, allocate memory at run-time, and deallocate that memory when it is no longer required.
#### Workshop 3: Member Functions and Privacy
Encapsulate a Train using the name, departure time, and number of passengers. Use member functions, privacy, safe empty state, and dynamic memory allocation to complete work.
#### Workshop 4: Constructors, Destructors, and the "this" object
Create default and overloaded constructors, destructors, initialize class member variables, and release member pointers.
#### Workshop 5: Member Operators, Helper functions
Implement different types of operator overloading in a partially developed class.
#### Workshop 6: Classes and resources, IO operators
Implement a class with overloaded constructors. Then you will overload IO operators that will be used to read and write on the screen and files.
#### Workshop 7: Derived Classes
Work with classes that make up a hierarchical structure.
#### Workshop 8: Virtual Functions and Abstract Base classes
Create a hierarchy of classes to practice and understand the role of virtual functions in inheritance.
#### Workshop 9: Derived Class with a Resource
Apply the rule of three to a class and its descendants.
#### Workshop 10: Templates
Create a function template with multiple type names and a function template module.
